## REST API principles:
- REST api has all nouns and no verb. Verbs are represented by http method.
- URIs are in two forms â€“ singular resource or collection. collection can be primary or secondary.
- Keep version of the api in the path so upgrade won't break older apis
 
## Data format:
- JSON or XML. Mostly preferred JSON.

## API:
- /employees  --browse all/primary collection
- /employees?from=0&to=100  --browse all/primary collection with filter. Also helps for Pagination
- /employees/{empid}  -- singular resource
- /depts
- /depts/{deptid}/employees  -- browse all but secondary collection employees within given dept.

## Http Methods - verbs - tells action:
- GET - idempotent - gets the data - non mutating
- POST - non-idempotent - creates new element - mutating
- PUT - idempotent - updates existing element - mutating
- DELETE - idempotent - deletes existing element - mutating
- PATCH - non-idempotent - partially update hierachy of elements - mutating

## HTTP response:
- 2xx - Success
- 3xx - redirects
- 4xx - client error (data not found, not authorized etc, no issues with server)
- 5xx - server error 

## Below could be achieved using additional parameters:
- Searching - /employees?lastname=khonde
- filtering - /employees?location=india also pagination related like /employees?from=100&to=150
- Sorting - /employees?sort=lastname&sorttype=asc
- Pagination - from and to or page number and page size
- Versioning - Versioning of api by putting version number as part of url. 
- Locking - optimetisic locking can be achived with concurrency counter number which can be sent back and forth while each update.
