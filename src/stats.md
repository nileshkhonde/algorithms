###### Types of variables
- Numeric - Discrete - Any whole numbers type of data is discrete, e.g. Polulation count. {0,1,2,...}
- Numeric - Continuous - Any fraction numbers data is continuous , e.g. Unemployment Rate. {0,1/2,3/4,2,...}
- Catagorical - Nominal - finite set of data, list of states 50 states in USA, not ordered. {NJ,NY,....}
- Catagorical - Ordinal - finite set of data, Education level, ordered. {highschool, grauduate, postgraduate,....}

- Associated or Dependent Variables - if one variable value is depend on another then its called associted or dependent.
- Positive association where variables are directly proportional and in negative association they are inversely proportional.

###### - Data Analysis
- Mean (Average) - add all sample data and divide by number of elements. x (bar on top) = x1+x2+....xn/n 
- Median - Middle value, order the data set elements and find the middle value, if it is even data set then average the middle two elements 
- Mode - The value that occures most in the data set.
- Interqurtile Range - is the range of data that is 25% percentile to 75% of the data set. Also called IQR
- Variance & Standard deviation 
  - Mean represents center of the data set, while Standard deviation is how far is the data spread from the center.
  - Deviation - Distance from the mean is called deviation.
  - variance = sq(x1-x) + sq(x2-x).....+sq(xn-x)/n-1 where x is mean.
  - Standard deviation = sqrt(variance)
  
###### Representation - 
- Scattered dots - shows relationship between two variables.
- Histogram - shows data density as bin/bar are higher when data density is more. Shows mode with highest height
            If data is too skewed we use transformations so that it fits in the graph. e.g. log to base 10.
- Intensity map - darker colors used to show higher number vs lighter color.
- Stacked Barplot - within bar it shows different colors to represent different data.
- Pie chart - circular representation with data shows with different colors of pie

###### Probablity - 
- Probability - What is probability of a outcome when randomly tried for finite number of times. It is always between 0 to 1
e.g. dice is rolled and probability of getting 1 is 1/6 (desired sample space/total sample spaces)
P(rolling 1) = 1/6 = 0.16 = 16%
P(rolling 1 or 2) = P(1) + P(2) = 1/6+1/6 = 2/6=1/3 = 0.33=33% (This gets added because event of 1 and 2 are disjoint event)
P(rolling 1 and 2) = P(1) + P(2) = 1/6+1/6 = 2/6=1/3 = 0.33=33%
P(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 1/6 +1/6 +1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6 =6/6=1=100%

- Disjoint event - Rolling dice and getting 1 or 2 is disjoint. Nothing common between them, we will either get 1 or 2.
- Non Disjoint event - Card in a suit which is dimond or face card. here Dimond face cards satisfies both criteria.
- P(dimond)+P(face) - P(dimond and face). We have to subtract the probability of dimond and face cards as it will be calculated in both probalities thus subtract it one time.

###### Conditional Probablity 
- Probability of A event to occur given event B occurred. P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)
- Bayers theorm - P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A)/P(B)
                - P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A)/P(B)
