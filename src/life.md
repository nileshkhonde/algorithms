What is living thing - convert energy, reproduce, grow, change.

Scientific method - Make an Observation, Make a hypothesis, Do experiements, draw conclusion.

Atom is smallest particle of element without loosing its properties.
1 million atoms in cross section of human hair
Atom has protons(+ve charge), neutron(neutral) and electron(-ve charge).
Old concept - neucleaus at the center which has protons and neutrons and Electrons are revolving around.
Atomic number - No of protons in the nucleaus of the element.
Current understanding - Neucleus at the center which has protons, neutrons and electons are hyze around neucleaus.
There is no way to locate the electrons at any given moment.
Each proton has 1 Atomic mass unit. So carbon as 6 protons and 6 neutrons so it is written as 12c6 (6 protons and 6 neutrons)
Isotop is same element with different atomic weight (by changing neutrons so 14c6 is caron isotop. 6 protons and 8 neutrons)
Octate rule of 8 electrons (with exception of 2 for He) which makes atom stable
Ionic bond - NaCl - Na has 1 extra electon and cl Needs one.
Covalence Bond - Oxygon needs two electrons and two Oxygen atom share their two electrons to make it a bond.

Capillary effect - glass attracts water drops more than water attracts itself so it acts like adhesive and water goes up in capillary tube.

Surface tension - the bond between molecules forms some kind of film which acts like surface tension.
