###### Arraylist
- Collection of items
- Array size is fixed. If larger size is needed later then, we have to recontruct the array.
e.g. 
String[] strArr = new String[] is array of strings.
Employee[] empArr = new Employee[] is array of employee class objects
- If we define a very large array than we need, then that memory is blocked/reserved and never used.
& Computer has to find large contiguous memory.
