###### Tree will have root and references to child nodes.
###### Binary tree will have atmost 2 children. Left and Right
###### Preorder Traversal - Visit the node then visit left child then visit right child.
###### Inorder Traversal - Visit the left subtree then visit node then visit right subtree.
###### Postorder Traversal - Visit the left subtree then visit right subtree visit node then.
###### BFS - Bread First Search - Nodes are visited level by level from top node. top node will be visited first and then level by level going to the bottom
###### DFS - Depth First Search - Depth is given a priority where in root is visited then we go in deep till a leaf of a branch then go up to root again 
and go bottom to another branch and so on. There are three types of traversal in DFS, Preorder, inorder and postorder.
