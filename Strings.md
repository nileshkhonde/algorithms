###### Strings
1. Reverse a string in place - Iterative or Recursion two pointer r =0 and l = s.length and swap and converge.
2. Reverse integer - use / and % to get each digit and multiply by 10 to push digit to left to get final number.
3. Find first non-unique character - Put char and its count in map. again another loop to check which first char has count == 1
4. Two strings are anagram - push each char in map with count from one string and remove char from map from another string, if map is empty then its anagram.
5. String is palindrom or not - two pointers left=0 and right=length-1 and compare.
6. Longest common prefix - two loops find the common prefix
