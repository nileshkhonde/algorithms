###### Map based - 
- Two Sum - Sum of two integers in array is equal to target. Keep every element in map number as key and value. Search target-current number in map.


###### Iterative 
- Reverse int - use mod and divide and get digits from right to move to left
- Int palindrome - divide number in two numbers till midway, reverse other number then comparing
- Roman to Integer - Build map to char to int and check IV, IX, XL,XC, CD, CM combinations. Keep adding to number.
- Merge two sorted lists - i,j,k indexes for array and increment indexes as we compare
- remove duplicates from sorted array - i,j index increament only when different number
- Remove element from array - i,j index increament j and keep i on element to remove and swap

###### Iterative Two pointers - String is Palindrome - Two pointers i and j check each char
                              - Integer is Palindrome - use mod % and / to reverse string and check if its same as remainder


###### Sliding Window 
- longest common prefix in words - hold currmax and max and keep comparing the chars
- haystack and needle - file needle string in haystack, two loop sliding window

###### Stack
- Valid parentheses - push opening brankets into stack and on closing bracket pop the stack and match.
