###### Map based - 
- Two Sum - Sum of two integers in array is equal to target. Keep every element in map number as key and value. Search target-current number in map.
- Alien Dictionary - Sort words based on alien dictionary, make map with rank of letters and comare them
- Design hash map - design hash - array of linkedlist - Pair object has key/valfind bucket - add to linked list - for finding data compare to all data in list
- Subdomain visit count - discuss.leetcode.com 9000 - each subdomain visit need to be count summed up and returned
###### Iterative 
- Reverse int - use mod and divide and get digits from right to move to left
- Int palindrome - divide number in two numbers till midway, reverse other number then comparing
- Roman to Integer - Build map to char to int and check IV, IX, XL,XC, CD, CM combinations. Keep adding to number.
- Merge two sorted lists - i,j,k indexes for array and increment indexes as we compare
- remove duplicates from sorted array - i,j index increament only when different number
- Remove element from array - i,j index increament j and keep i on element to remove and swap
- Buy sell Stock with max profit - loop through each element, find min continously and find max profit with Math.max 

###### Iterative Two pointers - String is Palindrome - Two pointers i and j check each char
                              - Integer is Palindrome - use mod % and / to reverse string and check if its same as remainder

###### Sliding Window 
- longest common prefix in words - hold currmax and max and keep comparing the chars
- haystack and needle - file needle string in haystack, two loop sliding window
- maxarry with max sum - initialize currsum and maxsum to first element, then get max of currsum or currsum+i th, and get max of currsum and maxsum
- Kadanes Algorithm - ?

###### Stack
- Valid parentheses - push opening brankets into stack and on closing bracket pop the stack and match.
- Min stack - get min of current stack data - keep two stacks one with actual data other with current min

###### Binary Search 
- Search number in sorted array.

###### Linked List 
- Reverse Linked list - prev, curr and next pointers and iterate with changing curr.next pointer to prev.
