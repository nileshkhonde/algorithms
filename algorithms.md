1. String Reversal 
  - For loop length-1 to 0 loop create new string.
  - Similar to stack ? Push from first to last and pop which will give last to first?
  
2. Palindrom 
  - Two pointers one points to start and another one to end and compare chars till we reach the middle (n/2)

3. Reverse of Int 
  - output = 0
  - while (input > 0 )
  - output = output * 10 + input % 10
  - input = input/10
  - Make it string and reverse the string
4. Find max char in a string
  - create a map of char to count and found the max (run time - 2n, Storage - 2n)
5. Fizzbuzz write fizz for divisible by 3 and buzz for divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz for divisible by 3 and 5
  - if n%5==0 && n%3==0 then fizzbuzz elseif n%3==0 print fizz elseif n%5==0 print buzz else print n
6. Array Chunking - [1,2,3,4] chunk into 2x2 arrays [[1,2],[3,4]]
